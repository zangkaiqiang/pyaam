# pyaam - active appearance model

active appearance models implemented in python

Code based on https://github.com/marcovzla/pyaam,https://github.com/tushuguanhaoya/pyaam

## Instructions

Download MUCT dataset:

    python -m pyaam.muct

View MUCT dataset:

    ./view_data.py

Train models:

    ./train_model.py shape
    ./train_model.py patches
    ./train_model.py detector
    ./train_model.py texture
    ./train_model.py combined

View models:

    ./view_model.py shape
    ./view_model.py patches
    ./view_model.py texture
    ./view_model.py combined

View face detector on webcam:

    ./view_face.py detector

View face tracker (patches):

    ./view_face.py tracker

Face tracker using AAMs coming soon!
